# Meme Picker!

I added some quality-of-life upgrades to this project that we built in a Scrimba course! Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript!

* Close the modal by clicking anywhere
* No gifs option checkbox!
* If one checkbox is checked and you click the other, the original selection will be unchecked!
* Added if else in order to display a message if no input is selected!
* Message is cleared when a radio is selected!!
* Pointer hand for button
